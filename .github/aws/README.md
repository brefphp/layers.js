## Setup

In order to let GitHub Actions retrieve layer versions from the Bref AWS account, we authorize GitHub via [OIDC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) instead of hardcoded AWS access keys.

This needs to be done once in the AWS console (because no access keys have permissions to deploy via CloudFormation).

- file: `github-role.yml`
- stack name: github-oidc-layers-js
- `FullRepoName` parameter: `brefphp/layers.js`
